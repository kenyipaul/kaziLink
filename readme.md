### KaziLink ###

 A platform that creates verifiable digital identities for informal sector workers (like domestic workers, artisans, market vendors, etc.) who currently lack formal work documentation. It's like a "LinkedIn for informal workers" but accessible through multiple technologies.


## Problem Space

-Millions of informal workers (domestic workers, market vendors, gardeners,
    handymen, etc.) have no way to prove their work history
-They often work for multiple employers but can't get formal references
-Without documented work history, they can't access loans, better jobs, or financial
    services
-Traditional ID systems don't capture informal work experience
    Trust between workers and potential employers is based purely on word of mouth


## Impact of the problem

-Workers stay trapped in low-paying informal jobs
-Can't negotiate better wages despite years of experience
-Banks see them as high-risk customers
-Skilled workers can't differentiate themselves from newcomers
-Employers struggle to verify claims of experience


## Potential Solution Components

1. Digital Profile Creation

-Simple phone-based registration (USSD/SMS for non-smartphone users)
-Voice-based verification for low literacy users
-Photo verification using basic phone cameras
-Ability to add skills and specialties

2. Work History Verification

-Employers can confirm work periods via SMS
-Rating system for reliability and skills
-Blockchain-based verification to prevent tampering
-Option for video testimonials from previous employers

3. Skill Certification

-Peer endorsements for specific skills
-Links to any informal training or apprenticeships
-Before/after photos of work (for trades like construction)
-Voice reviews from previous clients

4. Trust Network

-Community vouching system
-Reference checking through existing employers
-Integration with informal workers' associations
-Reputation scoring based on verified work history


## Technical Considerations ##

-Must work on basic phones
-Offline-first architecture for poor connectivity
-Multi-language support including local languages
-Data privacy and security for worker protection
-Low-cost or free for workers to use
-The uniqueness of this solution would be:

-Focus on informal sector needs
-Works without requiring formal documentation
-Builds trust through community verification
-Accessible to non-technical users
-Creates formal value from informal work history
